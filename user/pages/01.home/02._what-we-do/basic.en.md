        We host all our websites on [eco-efficient servers powered with renewable energy](#green-servers) and based locally in the UK. \n

        On these green servers we build fast websites with carefully crafted coding. Smaller file sizes increase efficiency and they also [improve your SEO](#how-site-speed-helps-SEO), or how well you rank with Google. \n

        All our websites come with the [GreenSpeed badge](#greenspeed-badge) to certify that you are enviornmentally responsible and that your website scores at least 79 in the [Google Page Speed test for mobiles](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). \n

        Are you a UK business or charity looking to green your network credentials? Then why not get in touch and ask us to run a review of your website and server?"
