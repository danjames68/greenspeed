        firstColumnContent: "I host all my websites on eco-efficient servers powered with renewable energy and based locally in the UK. \n

        On these green servers I build fast websites with carefully crafted coding. Smaller file sizes increase efficiency and they also improve your SEO, or how well you rank with Google. \n

        All my websites come with the GreenSpeed badge to certify that you are environmentally responsible and that your website scores at least 79 in the Google Page Speed test for mobiles. \n

        Are you a UK business or charity looking to green your network credentials? Then why not get in touch and ask me to run a review of your website and server?"

I call it "Design for Sustainability". We all need to use the internet and with careful design can minimise energy use while speeding up the response times, which in turns improves your SEO scores - so good news all round. Plus you get a badge!
