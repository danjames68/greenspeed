        firstColumnContent: "My name is Dan and I first started designing websites in the late 90s. They were tiny lightweight little things - they had to be, we were all on dial-up and data transfer was painfully slow.\n

        I stopped coding over 10 years ago but recently noticed how slow sites were loading even with broadband. A quick check with Google's '[page speed insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)' showed how many processes and squeezepoints any webpage can have.\n

        A slow website is a website that will lower your position in Google, annoy your customers and, I also discovered, is playing a part in the growth of our carbon emissions. The energy use of the internet shocked me - you can read more about it in [my e-book](https://mailchi.mp/5cb10484586a/greenspeedstudio) - but it became clear that it would be a worthwhile endeavour to try and 'green the internet'\n
        
        Many small businesses only need simple flat-file sites, and if we then power them on servers powered by renewable energy we get a fast, green website that if better for SEO. So it's a classic win-win process. So that's what I do, but if you would just like to look into it yourself feel free to start with the book."

Data-centres and server farms use as much energy as a small country and the rate is growing. It makes sense to minimise our energy consumption with carefully crafted code running on servers powered by renewable energy sources.
